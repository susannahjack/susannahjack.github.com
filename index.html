<h1>The Great Entitled White Male Handbook: Sleaze Up. Score Hookworms. Be Covered in Grease.</h1>

<p>The other day I encountered this book. Bumptiously endorsed by Barney Stinson (scumbag character in How I Met Your Mother) who, according to the wiki, is "a serial womanizer with father issues and questionable actions" super-ironically portrayed by Neil Patrick Harris, Meta-Queer-Post-Ironic-King-Extraordinaire.</p>

<h2>My favourite picture from The Book!</h2>

<p><img src="http://i.imgur.com/ShsPGp2.jpg?1" alt="pp"></p>

<h3>What is wrong with this picture?</h3>

<p>Firstly, the writers of this book are conclusively confident in the viability of a rudimentary sketch of Buxom Floozies being openly objectified in an 18th C British Pub in initiating the Boyz II Men process of Successfully Picking Up.</p>

<p>Pls note that in 18th C London, like, one in five women <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-1219347/Sin-city-Georgian-London-evokes-images-elegance-fine-art--truth-women-prostitutes.html">Or Some Daily Mail Statistic In an Austentatious Article</a> earned a living as prostitutes, and The Pub was a domain for working men to gamble, brawl, booze it up and have a great time snuffling out a gropeable broad etc..  so this is the demographic we are happy with as a reference point. Sweet. Let's go.</p>

<p>Well, I would have to be a complete Hermit Prude Yetihaired Babyeater to suggest that this isn't in fact a relative mirror of what The Club is now, except that the women get paid exclusively in Beverages and Objectification Flattery and maybe later shifted to a more respectful domain e.g McNulty's special Dinner &amp; a Movie if they're lucky. <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2013/01/phil_gingrey_todd_akin_and_richard_mourdock_the_gop_s_rape_problem_is_spreading.html">Let's let Todd Akin and Bros illustrate what will happen if a woman is unlucky..</a></p>

<p>Has anyone seen Grease? I love my Subaru, skulling litres of Mother and quaffing kilos of shaved lyposausage, baby vom Kebabs with my mates// a doubled-over, blind wasted girl I picked up at the end of the night.</p>

<p><img src="http://i54.tinypic.com/345lool.jpg" alt="sbro"></p>

<p>I would, again, have to be a NeoConservative Femonazi Vagina Dentata Castration Cult High Priestess in order to deny that lolle obv this Objectification Flattery is really liberation of women thru sexuality, ankle-twisting in Carrie Bradshaw's Manolo Blahnik heel-prints. </p>

<p>But too bad, guess what?! </p>

<p>I find women so attractive that I wish they would stop being gross because of their insecurities when I want to make them feel ecstatic and fulfilled. 
I don't want them to Put It Away, I want them to let me seduce them slowly, with plenty of cognitive stimulation and Good Times, ohne Drogen bitte.</p>

<p>I find women so attractive that I wish more men would accentuate their femininity way more often, Not Just, Like, Physically/Aesthetically (altho, yes, preferably extending the gender fluidity in contexts outside of The Queer Club and Mardi Gras) but in their choice of acceptance of thoughts and roles (real feminists, mixed gender sports participators/ ice skaters, gymnasts, ballet dancers, cheer leaders, advocators of movement for women in employment and education).</p>

<p>Whether a woman is a 'Hag' or not does not change how you as a 'Human' (regardless of gender) see her. 
Especially tho if you are a NeoColonialist Patriarchal White Male, this is you Bintang Bali Pussay Patrol WifeBeater clad British Backpackers sauntering around the subtropics rubbing your dicks on everything and chundering everywhere!</p>

<h4>So onto the next point.</h4>

<p>What the fuck is going on with the semantics//pragmatics justifying this picture?</p>

<p>Well the use of and implicature surrounding pronouns "chicks", "bros", "kid", "noob", "Korea". 
Again, NeoColonialist Patriarchal White Males. </p>

<p>The Chick's role in the sentence (and by extension situation) is to be the Object being verbed (chatted up, reasonably depicted in an illustration, approached). She is a passive entity.
A Chick cannot be part of a collective of Bros. This isolates her from being an agent in any non-Chick group activities which I will describe below.</p>

<p>The Bros are the Subjects whose roles are to potentially action the above processes. 
If they do this they will be rewarded with a tasty female snack.</p>

<p>But heel, overzealous slobbering mongrels!</p>

<p>The Bros who commit passive verbs (sitting, debating, deliberating) yield pathetic results: "skulking home sad and alone". 
They do not achieve their goals as Subjects. Fail!</p>

<p>The Bros who are busy committing to cultural acts seemingly contrary (at first read) to going out and getting smashed (getting caught up in an epic WoW PvP, pwning noobs, being victims of server crashes) are completely excluded from the equation. Meaning that the cultural capital of any gaming oriented pastimes are cancelled out when a Pussay Patroling Opportunity arises! Epic Fail!</p>

<p>Option C for our puerile Subjects is the most verbose with expert detail about the institution being acerbically dissed. 
I see, so as an only-just-functioning autistic gamer (who is lucky to have a Bro-herd that will put up with me because of my Mad Skills and ability to Chug Mountain Dew) I too can hope to transcend my pitiful condition and become an Entitled Womanising Empiricist Vice Sycophant White Guy Author who revels in Madmen marathons in his Suitjamas with an upgrade from soda pop to the hard stuff: JD&amp;Cock.</p>

<p>In the meantime we are encouraged to Pwn Korean Kid Noobs: smite that Oriental Enemy, unless she's a Korean Chick in which case you should wipe off the sweat of your Dengue Fevered brow and try to lure her Spicy Snatch towards webcam.</p>

<p>Sadly, you're a long way from levelling up from the Rankboysweat Gaming Den to the Club and Smash Mandicooching that Womanly Wumpa Fruit.</p>
